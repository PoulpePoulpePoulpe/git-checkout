# Why this script?
I sometimes work on a multi-repositories project. So I needed to checkout the same branch on all my repos (like `master`)

Once installed, you can go to the main directory (not a git one) then type `git-checkout master` (and `pop` option if you want to perform a `git stash pop` after the checkput) and it'll tell you everything.


# Install

* Create the file on the directory of your choice
* Type (on a terminal): `$ chmod +x git-checkout`
* Then type: `$ mv git-checkout /usr/local/bin/git-checkout` to have it available
